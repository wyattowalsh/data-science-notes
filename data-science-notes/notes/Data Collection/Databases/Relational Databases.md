# Relational Databases
A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables, which consist of rows and columns. Each table represents a different type of entity, such as customers, orders, or products, and each row represents a specific instance of that entity, while each column represents a specific attribute of that entity.

Relational databases use a language called SQL (Structured Query Language) to retrieve and manipulate data. SQL allows users to create, read, update, and delete data from the database.

The relationship between tables in a relational database is defined by a primary key and a foreign key. The primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table, while the foreign key is a reference to a primary key in another table. This allows data to be linked and accessed across different tables.

Relational databases are widely used in businesses and organizations to manage and store data. They offer data consistency, data integrity, and the ability to easily query and manipulate data. However, they can be less flexible than other types of databases, such as NoSQL databases, which can handle unstructured data more easily.
