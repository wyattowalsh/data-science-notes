## Hey, glad to see you here! üëã 

You have just landed in the repository of the *open-source* website: [MakeUseofData.com](https://makeuseofdata.com/)!     

The first project of this website is building a robust collection of notes across topics in ***data science***. Currently, [Jupyter Book](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book) is being used to build the site, so there are a wide variety (`.md`, `.ipynb`, and more) of files to use for contributions. 

Check out the [`issues`](https://github.com/wyattowalsh/data-science-notes/issues) tab to see where you can help out! Right now, basics across the different subjects are being added, but anything on the topic of *data science* is welcome!

The [`discussions`](https://github.com/wyattowalsh/data-science-notes/discussions) tab has a few threads that could be interesting to check out. This note project as well as the greater MakeUseofData project are quite open-ended so creative suggestions for possible content are warmly welcomed.

### Motivation

This project was first created as a place to host notes of one of the contributors as he endeavored to study various data science topics for job interviews. However, throughout that research, it was noticed that information on data science topics had wide dispersion; there were many many different sources of information to synthesize knowledge across the topics. Having seen the success of *Jupyter Book* deployments across several UC Berkeley courses, such as Data 8 with its textbook, [InferentialThinking.com](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro) it seemed like a good technology to create a repository of data science information since mathematical typesetting, in-page Jupyter Notebook usage, and additional plugins were available for use. 

### Contributing 

We warmly welcome and recognize all contributions. 

You can see a list of current contributors in the [contributors tab](https://github.com/wyattowalsh/data-science-notes/graphs/contributors).

Please see [**here**](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contributing guidelines and check out the [**issues**](https://github.com/wyattowalsh/data-science-notes/issues) to get oriented üòä. 

### Credits

This project is created using the excellent open source [Jupyter Book project](https://jupyterbook.org/) and the [executablebooks/cookiecutter-jupyter-book template](https://github.com/executablebooks/cookiecutter-jupyter-book)
