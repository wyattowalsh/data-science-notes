# Formatting Guidelines for **_Data Science Notes_**

Currently, **_Data Science Notes_** is built on the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) platform. This means that Jupyter Notebooks, plain Markdown files, and [**several other formats**](https://jupyterbook.org/file-types/index.html) are available to compose content.

The authors recommend so far to compose `.md` files within a Markdown editor that supports robust markdown syntax including support for *LaTeX* typesetting. An editor that supports custom HTML blocks, as well as other Markdown plugins, could make the workflow easier as well. [Mark Text](https://marktext.app/) is a good choice app and is available for free currently.

The **Write Book Content** section of the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) website can prove quite useful for seeing the syntactical possibilities available to contribute content.

Content should be written in a similar form as other sections utilizing tools such as *LaTeX* typesetting or highlighted code snippets if necessary.

**Please include sources at the bottom of your content if applicable!**
